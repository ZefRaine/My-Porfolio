            <p> My name is Zeph Tambornino. I am a Minnesota native living in Minneapolis. Currently I am enrolled as
                coding
                bootcamp student, however, I wasn't always pursuing a career in web development.</p>

            <p>I am a passionate musician who has performed as a vocalist at many presitgious locations such as the
                Ordway
                and the Minnesota Orchestra Hall.</p>

            <p> I also have been playing guitar, drums and piano for over 10 years.
                When I can I make sure to go biking as much as I can, but in the winter I play more videogames and
                stream
                for fun. Most of the time I do what I do everynight and try to take over the world.
            </p>

            <p> Due to my problem solving proficiencies have a strong understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I
                primarily use these languages along with MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js)</p>
