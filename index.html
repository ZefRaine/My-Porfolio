            My name is Zeph Tambornino. I am a Minnesota native living in Minneapolis. Currently I am enrolled as coding
            bootcamp student, however, I wasn't always pursuing a career in web development.
            I am a passionate musician who has performed as a vocalist at many presitgious locations such as the Ordway
            and the Minnesota Orchestra Hall.
            I also have been playing guitar, drums and piano for over 10 years.
            When I can I make sure to go biking as much as I can, but in the winter I play more videogames and stream
            for fun. Most of the time I do what I do everynight and try to take over the world.
            Master of JFGI.
